Project Name | Area | Description | Libraries
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
üõç [Spotify Recommendation Model using Machine Learning](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Projects/Spotify%20Recommendation%20Model%20using%20Machine%20Learning) | Recommendation Model | In this project, I've developed a music recommendation model using machine learning techniques that functions similarly to Spotify's algorithm. |Pandas, NumPy matplotlib, seaborn
üèô [Hate & Offensive Speech Detection Machine Learning Model ](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Projects/Hate%20%26%20Offensive%20Speech%20Detection%20Machine%20Learning%20Model) | Sentimental Analysis |  In this post, I will walk you through the development of a hate speech detection model using Machine Learning and Python. Hate Speech Detection is often a sentiment classification task. So, for training, creating a model that can recognise hate speech from a specific piece of text may be accomplished by training it on data that is often used to categorise feelings. As a result, I will employ Twitter data for the purpose of hate speech detection model. |Pandas, NumPy, nltk, Sklearn
ü¶† [Market Basket Analysis](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Projects/Unsupervised%20Learning%20%20Market%20Basket%20Analysis) | Basket Analysis |  The Apriori algorithm is used in Machine Learning to extract association rules from datasets. In this tutorial, I will walk you through Market Basket Analysis utilising the Apriori method in Machine Learning using Python. Typically, association mining is conducted on transaction data from a retail marketplace or an online e-commerce business.|Pandas, NumPy, Apriori, plotly
üõç  [Webscraping Internships data from Internshala](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Projects/Webscraping%20Internships%20data%20from%20Internshala)) | WebScraping |  The Webscraped internship data for analysis. | NumPy, Pandas, AutoScraper
ü¶Ñ  [Real Time Stock Data Analysis](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Projects/Real%20Time%20Stock%20Data%20Analysis) | WebScraping & Data Analysis |  The Webscraped & performed data analysis on AMZ, TSLA, GameStop stocks. | bs4, beautifulSoup, plotly, yfinance, pandas
üõç [Spot the Difference Tool (For Preventing Cyber Attacks](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Python%20Projects/OpenCv%20Spot%20the%20Difference%20Tool%20(For%20Preventing%20Cyber%20Attacks)) | OpenCV Project | Build a OpenCV tool which spot the differences between to 2 identical images. This tool is effective in preventing  cyber attacks. | NumPy, imutils, cv2
