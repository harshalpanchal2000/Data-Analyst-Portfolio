ü¶Ñ [HeartBeats - Because, we care](https://github.com/harshalpanchal2000/Personal_Projects/tree/main/Tableau%20Projects/Making%20Sales%20Manager's%20life%20Easier) | Engineered an interactive R Shiny app for precise cardiovascular health prognostication, drawing from a robust model trained on an expansive dataset of 50,000 patient profiles. The app ingeniously integrates user-input variables encompassing age, height, weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, cholesterol, lifestyle factors like drinking, smoking, and exercise frequency. With a remarkable 91% predictive accuracy, the model empowers users to gauge their cardiovascular well-being. The app was seamlessly deployed online using shinyapps.io, making it easily accessible for users to assess their health and receive personalized precautionary measures. This project underscores my expertise in predictive analytics, dynamic UI/UX design, and web-based deployment. | [Click Here](https://fwwir3-harshal-panchal.shinyapps.io/HeartBeat/)   | Model-Based Testing, Exploratory Data Analysis, SQL, R, Cloud Deployment

Forest fires pose a significant threat, necessitating urgent attention to understand and mitigate their effects. The focus is particularly on the Algerian region, grappling with distinct challenges and contributing to the urgency of finding effective solutions. Our project takes a proactive stance, anchored in the formidable capabilities of the Apache Beam framework for data processing and analysis. By directing our exploration towards the "Algerian Forest Fires Dataset," a rich repository of vital information, we aim to uncover hidden patterns, identify trends, and highlight anomalies. Leveraging Apache Beam's prowess, our strategy is to shed light on the intricate factors influencing forest fires in Algeria. This comprehensive understanding serves as the foundation for devising more effective mitigation strategies, addressing the core problem at its roots.| [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tebe_erOZL0)  |  Understanding Data Problem, Basic Exploratory Data Analysis, Quantitative Research, Background check, Research Papers parsing
